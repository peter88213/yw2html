This is an example of how to create a PDF to print a paperback using yw2html and LibreOffice. 

Here's how: 

1. Install the supplied fonts. They are best supported by LibreOffice 6 or more recent.

2. Create a link to the "examples\paperback.bat" batch file on the desktop. 

3. Customize the HTML templates in the examples\template\paperback directory.

4. Customize the OTT document template and install it in your LibreOffice user profile. 

5. Create and customize a book document from this template.  

6. Drag the yWriter project and drop it on the "paperback.bat" link icon.

7. Open the generated HTML file from LibreOffice Writer. Copy everything to the clipboard. 

8. Paste everything just one line above the table of contents in your book document.

9. Update the table of contents.
