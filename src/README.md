# Please note:

In order to get a stand-alone script, all modules used from the  _PyWriter_  library first have to be "inlined" by "build" scripts.

Location of the  _PyWriter_  library: https://github.com/peter88213/PyWriter

It is advised to clone the  _PyWriter_  project at the same directory level as the  _yw-cnv_  project. So the build scripts can generate the  _yw-cnv_  scripts.
